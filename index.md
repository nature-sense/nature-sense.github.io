## AI Camera Trap

The first Naturesense project is a low-cost **AI-based Insect Camera Trap**, which can be used to count and identify insects for research purposes, in agriculture and in other areas.

The trap is designed to be easy to use. It is managed using bluetooth and a simple phone app, and the recorded data is written to a USB memory stick, which can be read offline for further processing.

The main component in the trap is the **AI camera** which is based around a Raspberry Pi Camera 3 and a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (or CM5). This has the same processor as the standard Raspberry Pi 5 (a a 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 CPU running at 2.4GHz.), but in a much smaller package. The power of board allows many AI tasks to be run directly on the processor, without requiring hardware accelleration. The camera is very small measuring only 60mm  x 53mm x 30mm.

The second component is waterproof case that can accomodate the camera and a power bank (battery), and allows the camera to be used outside;
